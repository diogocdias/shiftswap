# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

While this project uses React, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Vite project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

```shell
$ vercel
```

## Running it locally

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

Install dependencies (first time only):

`npm install`

Start the development server:

`npm run dev`

Open your browser:

The terminal will show a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
Click on it or copy/paste it into your browser

Other useful commands:

npm run build - Creates a production build
npm run preview - Preview the production build locally
npm run lint - Check for code issues

Troubleshooting:

If you get errors about missing dependencies, try deleting node_modules folder and package-lock.json, then run npm install again
Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended)
If port 5173 is already in use, Vite will automatically use the next available port

The app will automatically reload when you save changes to your files (Hot Module Replacement)!
